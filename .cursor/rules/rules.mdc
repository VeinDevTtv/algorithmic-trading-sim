Project Title: Algorithmic Trading Simulator
Project Overview

The Algorithmic Trading Simulator is a fully interactive simulation of a stock/crypto exchange designed to mimic the core functionalities of real-world trading platforms. The simulator allows multiple traders to place limit and market orders, manage positions, and execute trades in real-time against an automated order matching engine.

Unlike typical trading apps, this project focuses on object-oriented design, efficient data structures, and algorithmic implementation, providing a showcase of software engineering skills beyond simple CRUD operations.

Key Features
1. Order Book and Matching Engine

Dynamic Order Book: Maintains all open buy and sell orders sorted by price and time priority.

Order Types:

Limit Orders: Execute only at a specified price or better.

Market Orders: Execute immediately at the best available price.

Matching Logic:

Buy orders are matched with sell orders where Buy Price â‰¥ Sell Price.

Supports partial fills (an order can be partially matched if quantity differs).

Data Structures: Uses priority queues, heaps, or balanced BSTs to maintain orders efficiently.

2. Trader Accounts and Risk Management

Each trader has a cash balance and a portfolio of holdings.

Traders can place and cancel orders, monitor open positions, and track trade history.

Risk Management Features:

Stop-loss implementation

Maximum exposure limits

Order validation (insufficient balance or overexposure rejected)

3. Market Simulation (Optional Advanced Feature)

Simulate market activity with bot traders placing random orders.

Include price volatility, creating a realistic trading environment.

Generate OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) candlestick data for visualization.

4. Architecture & Object-Oriented Design

Order: Encapsulates all attributes of an order (ID, type, side, price, quantity, timestamp).

OrderBook: Maintains buy/sell orders with efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

MatchingEngine: Executes trades by matching compatible orders, handles partial fills, and updates trader accounts.

Trader: Manages user balance, positions, and order history.

MarketSimulator (optional): Generates dynamic market activity for a realistic trading environment.

5. Data Structures and Algorithms

Priority Queues / Heaps: For efficient retrieval of best bid and ask prices.

Hash Maps: Track trader portfolios, order IDs, and trade history efficiently.

Linked Lists: Optional for order queues to support fast insertions/deletions.

Sorting and Search Algorithms: For matching orders and generating reports.

Optional Advanced DSA: Segment trees or balanced BSTs for historical price queries.

6. Technology Stack

Backend: Python (core simulation)

Libraries: heapq, bisect, datetime

Optional Frontend:

React.js or Three.js for interactive visualization of order book and trades

Persistence: JSON or SQLite for trade history and order snapshots

7. Learning Outcomes / Skills Demonstrated

Object-Oriented Programming: Modeling complex systems using clean, maintainable classes and interfaces.

Data Structures & Algorithms: Using heaps, trees, and queues to implement a high-performance trading engine.

System Design: Understanding order flow, matching engines, and risk management.

Optional Visualization: Frontend integration for real-time data display.

Portfolio Impact: A unique project that stands out due to its algorithmic complexity and practical relevance.

8. Stretch Goals / Extensions

Implement multiple trading strategies or bots.

Support multiple asset types (stocks, crypto, futures).

Introduce latency simulation to mimic real-world order execution delays.

Build an API for traders to programmatically place orders.

Visualize live order book depth and trade activity in a 3D interactive UI.
